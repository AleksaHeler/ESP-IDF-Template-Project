## Installation/prerequisites

Easiest thing to do, is first install plugin for VS Code, and then follow the steps as shown [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/vscode-esp-idf-extension/en/latest/installation.html). Just find and install extension called "ESP-IDF" from Espressif Systems.

Run the setup and select "Express" install option. Select newest ESP-IDF version (v5.4 as of writing).

Now you can use the "New Project Wizard" for ESP-IDF.
